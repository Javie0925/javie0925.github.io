Hello, my name is Javie. I always want to build a blog website of my own. I tried to build a server by myself, but it is had to maintain the server. I wrote a blog server with Jave and deployed it in my old android phone with [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) and exploded the web site with a [NAT](https://natapp.cn/) server. However, it turned out to be hard to maintain the server and everything because a phone server is not stable due to the network or the power. In another hand, I had to pay the NAT server every month. Finally, I shut down the server for good.
Recently, when I was surfing in the github, I found someone introduced how to make a blog site with git-page and Jekyll. I found it really cool and decided to have a try.

Jekyll is easy. It was written with Ruby and base on Liquid template language. You can totally figure it out if you look through this [blog](https://juejin.cn/post/6844903623567081486). You can also learn from the [Jekyll official website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) and the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) doc site.
There are many Jekyll themes in the Internet, you can easily get one if you google it. I got this really cool theme from (jekyllthemes)[http://jekyllthemes.org/]. I will build my own blog site base on this cool theme. 
I will try to write something down and record something interesting.

Thanks for reading!
